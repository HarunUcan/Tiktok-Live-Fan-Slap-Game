# Tiktok-Live-Fan-Slap-Game

**Tiktok-Live-Fan-Slap-Game** is a **demo version** of an interactive Unity-based game built for TikTok live streams. In this project, two rival fan groups (e.g., GS vs FB) compete by slapping each other — and every gift from viewers triggers a slap from their side!

This version is a **functional prototype**, created to demonstrate the gameplay concept and TikTok gift integration logic.
